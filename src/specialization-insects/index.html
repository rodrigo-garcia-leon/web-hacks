        <h1>Specialization Is for Insects</h1>
        <p>
          A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a
          ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone,
          comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
          analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight
          efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.
        </p>
